# Raspberry PI IoT Security Vulnerability Final College Project for Security Class

Considering the increase of IoT devices, this work proposes a weakness evaluation in IoT network of devices and possible solutions. This security IoT project uses a LM35 sensor with Raspberry Pi.

## IMPLEMENTATION

This project covers a IoT devices network using HTTP transmission between two Raspberry Pi 3 B model, which one of the Rasps collects the sensor temperature and the other one acts like a webserver with Flask to provide the temperature data to a mobile device - developed with VueJS 2 and PWA boilerplate. This way, the user can check if there's a fire with his/her mobile device.

As security will be in check, network transmissions will always have a Darth reading and modifying the collected data. The proposed solution aims to fight Darth (not Vader, but as evil as him) to ensure data integrity and confidentiality through cryptography techniques. This will ensure to the server to identify if the received information was tamperd or from a unknown source.

## STEPS

1\. Raspberry sensor server (in development)

2\. [Raspberry Flask Webserver (in development)](https://github.com/davikawasaki/iot-security-vulnerability/tree/master/webserver)

3\. [Progressive Web App with VueJS (in development)](https://github.com/davikawasaki/iot-security-vulnerability/tree/master/pwa)
